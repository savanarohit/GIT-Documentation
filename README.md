#### Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks source code changes during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work.

#### Key Concepts

Repository (Repo): A storage location for your project, where Git stores the project history and configuration.
Commit: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
Branch: A parallel version of your project, allowing you to work on different features or fixes simultaneously.
Merge: Combining changes from different branches into one.
Remote: A version of your project hosted on the internet or network.
Clone: A copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
Pull: Updating your local repository with changes from a remote repository.
Push: Sending your local changes to a remote repository.
